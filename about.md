Hello there! I'm a dedicated game developer with a strong foundation in *Roblox* game development. Currently, I'm pursuing a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science** while also serving as the **Engineering Director** for *The Game Developer's Association at the University of Oklahoma*. In this role, I not only share my technical expertise but also educate fellow game developers on the intricacies of the craft.

Building upon my solid background in *Roblox* game development, I've expanded my skill set to include popular tools such as *Unity* and *Godot*. This allows me to bring game ideas to life across various platforms, unlocking new possibilities and reaching a wider audience.

If you're passionate about game development and would like to discuss ideas, explore potential collaborations, or engage in meaningful conversations, I would be thrilled to connect with you.
