Hello there! I'm a dedicated game developer with a strong foundation in Roblox game development. Currently pursuing a **Bachelor's in Computer Science**, I also hold the student position of **Engineering Director** at *The Game Developer's Association at the University of Oklahoma*. Through this role, I share my technical expertise and educate fellow game developers on the intricacies of the craft.

With a solid background in *Roblox* game development, I've expanded my skill set to include popular tools like *Unity* and *Godot*, enabling me to bring game ideas to life across multiple platforms.

*If you're interested in discussing game development, exploring collaborations, or engaging in meaningful conversations, I'd be delighted to connect.*
